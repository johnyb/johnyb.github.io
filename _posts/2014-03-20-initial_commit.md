So this is, how you start a personal blog … I’ve setup jekyll a while back and started playing around with it.
After a few hours of fiddling, I left this project as is and started doing something else.
I guess, that doesn’t sound like a successful start, but anyway.

Now, a few months later, I’m at a point to continue on this project.
I made up my mind on what content should find its way into this instance of jekyll and will start contributing some of my ideas.
I’ve been working on a few interesting projects and now is the time to offer some extended documentation of those through
a channel like this.

Some topics I want to cover include things like:

* BDD in JavaScript projects
* Using grunt to organise the build process of JavaScript projects
* Doing PGP/Crypto in the browser
* I18n for web projects
* Custom theming Rich Internet Applications
* Interesting projects, I’ve been working on
* Stuff I haven’t thought about, yet

Since this is just an initial commit to get started, I will leave you with the list above and hope to see you soon.
